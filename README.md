# MiCartera


**MiCartera** is an open-source project with a goal of demonstrating **Hexagonal Architecture**, **Domain-driven Design**, **Clean Code** practices and **SOLID** principles. The **PHP Symfony framework** was chosen to accomplish a fully working and functional example but since the application domain (src/xVer/MiCartera) is completely detached from the framework the transition to a different one can be easily accomplished.
